# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image files for your app:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1242x2436px recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px recommended)

## Quick Setup

You can generate these assets using:
- Expo's asset generator: `npx expo install expo-asset`
- Online tools like [AppIcon.co](https://www.appicon.co/) or [IconKitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)

For now, the app will work without these assets, but it's recommended to add them before publishing.
